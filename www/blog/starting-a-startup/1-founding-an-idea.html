                        <p>When you think of a company, you tend to think of its products, its aspirations, its stock price, or even its website. The way we view companies is, from one angle, either how it helps or how it hurts you personally. People though have faces, they have bodies, and each of those is unique. They wear clothes and have fashion, they have shoes and shirts. Startups don't have any of that, instead they must make do with a website, or an office building, or a blog, or a logo. Although people do share one main thing in common with a venture, they both have names. What a name says about a corporation is different to each individual. Everyone has such vast life experiences that when given only the name of a company, everyone comes to their own conclusions. Well, that being said, we decided to release the process of starting our startup in a series of blog posts, the first of which will be on the naming of our startup, Meta Inc.</p>
                        <p>For Meta-Inc. we started with a rough idea, maybe technology could be easier to use, maybe we could help bring solutions to people who want some improvements in their lives, maybe we could start a new venture. We call it Meta Inc. because of long term use of EMACS, which is a code editor. EMACS is capable of being able to quickly generate ideas into code, and is language agnostic. Meaning that if you want to program a program, whether it be an app or website, we tend to rely on EMACS to aid us in the process. Anyways, in that program there is something called the Meta key, really it is just a re-branded Alt key, but in the editor it holds mystical powers of ease of use of commands.</p>
                        <img src="/img/being-tree.jpg"  class="img-fluid blog-pic" alt="Being, means being able to be anything.">
                        <p>We feel that the word meta has many definitions and is a neat sounding word. We believe that upon hearing meta, people tend to think of something one step more abstract, but not too abstract. Maybe that is just us but we hope to start a cool company, and the first step in that is the name. Companies love, well nothing really, but the people behind them and the users of their products need something to identify them with, a corporate name. It took a bit to think of and in all honesty, just sounds sweet.</p>
                        <p>Now then, we are going to be documenting the steps taken to create Meta Inc. in a series of blog posts. We will chronicle the various decisions we have to make and we will be honest along the way. Thanks for reading and we hope that these blog posts serve as interesting pieces of text for anyone who is curious about businesses, startups, or just likes a strange story. We will be posting, in this series, on Sunday.</p>
