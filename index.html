	                      <p>The possibilities in life, all the possible lives to live, all the ways you can become what you dare, and all the hope that comes with being human, are granted by the very nature of us living, dreaming, daring, and excelling. We are all capable of accomplishing the grand, we are all capable of becoming our own destiny, and we are all able to arrive at tomorrow, better equipped then today. Time is not an enemy to be ignored, it is our strongest ally in the field of progress.</p>
                        <p>Progress, the name sparks different emotions for different people but, as the clock tocks and ticks, as we discover new ideas and thoughts, new ways to live, and new ways to spend our time, it becomes apparent that progress is also a part of human nature. At Meta Inc. we realise the need to aid the advancement of our species, not for the sake of ego or pure money, but because we know, deep down, it is what we have been gifted to do. In each of us is born two beings, the being in the present, and the being of in the future. Although we don't know how the two connect, we hope by helping our fellow man, we can make some people's future a bit better.</p>
                        <p>When starting a new venture, it is common to dream big. We dream big but at the same time, we dream small, we dream of the future and the present, and we dream of stepping into the future with a bit more karma each day. In short, we are starting a new company, one in which its future version helps mankind, one in which its present day operations are exciting and fun, and one in which one day we hope to share our inventions with you, the reader, the human, a person who dreams. We will be launching our first invention in a bit, and we hope to share the journey with you. To follow the journey of Meta Inc. as we get our ideas a bit more refined and turn them into inventions, we will leave this link, <a href="blog/blog-posts.html" class="teal">here.</a> Congrats on being human, make well with your ally time and go to sleep excited for what you can do tomorrow.</p>
