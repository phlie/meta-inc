	                      <p>The mind is a place of thought, personality, and continuously computes the unknowns of the future. To think makes you human, to do something with those thoughts a champion, and to carry those thoughts through to completion, an everyday hero. The challenge with life is that we don’t know what impacts tomorrow will have on today, and, since there is no way to reverse time, we seldom get it right.</p>
	                      <p>At Meta Inc., we are not attempting to get it “right”. Instead we are learning all the time, creating words and computations, and mimicking nature. We know that in this great sphere of existence, lies happiness, possibility, and hope. Hope that tomorrow was planned for by today, but, happiness even if the plans fall through. We all love to be ourselves, because, you are you, the human being that thinks, when tomorrow comes, it will be better than today.</p>
	                      <p>Take care for now,<br /> Matt.</p>
